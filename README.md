# Welcome to ```wordplays```!
Hello, world! This is a repository filled with my projects related to wordplay. If you're interested in how I used 
Python to find special words (such as dollar words), you're in the right place!

# Projects
- dollarwords
## ```dollarwords```
### What's a 'dollar word'?
A dollar word is a word whose numeric counterparts add up to 100, with "a" being 1, "b" being 2, and so on. *Molecular*, for example,
is a dollar word: 13(m) + 15(o) + 12(l) + 5(e) + 3(c) + 21(u) + 12(l) + 1(a) + 18(r) = 100! Dollar words are not case-sensitive.
### Files
- ```word.py```: processes one word at a time and gives information about the word,
returning any kind of words - even those that are not dollar words.
- ```paragraph.py```: processes paragraphs (or even chapters!) at a time, returning only dollar words.

# Conclusion
I hope these programs prove useful (or at least somewhat entertaining) to you! Happy coding!
