# Welcome
Hello, world! Welcome to this repository. If you wish to encrypt or decrypt phrases, these programs are for you! Simply enter the words you wish to encrypt or decrypt in the corresponding program, and it'll will add up the total numbers of each word.

### What's a 'cipher'?
A cipher is a "code" -- a way of disguising, called "encrypting," words. 
Caesar cipher, substitution cipher, and pigpen cipher are some examples of ciphers.

### ```caesarcipher.py```
The Caesar cipher was first used by -- you guessed it -- Julius Caeser himself. This cipher involves shifting letters down the alphabet
by a predetermined number of letters. For example, if the number of letters to shift by (called the "key") is 3, then then the letter _a_
would become _d_, _b_ becomes _e_, _c_ becomes _f_, and so on. Here's an example of how this program works:
```
Enter number of letters to shift by: 3
Enter phrase to encrypt or decrypt: This is an example of a Caesar cipher. This text will become unreadable when the program has shifted all letters three letters down.
Encrypt or decrypt (e/d)? e
